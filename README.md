\# A Reproducible Pipeline for Leveraging Operational Data through Machine Learning in Digitally Emerging Urban Bus Fleets



This repository contains the complete machine learning pipeline developed for the study:



\*\*"A Reproducible Pipeline for Leveraging Operational Data through Machine Learning in Digitally Emerging Urban Bus Fleets"\*\*, submitted to \*Applied Sciences (MDPI)\*, Special Issue on Big-Data-Driven Advances in Smart Maintenance and Industry 4.0.

\## Overview



This work presents a reproducible and adaptive ML pipeline for predictive maintenance in hybrid urban buses operating under data scarcity conditions. The project includes:



\- Preprocessing and cleaning of ECU (Electronic Control Unit) data

\- Feature engineering based on fuel intensity and operational logic

\- Application of interpretable and lightweight models (Linear Regression, Ridge, KNN, Decision Tree)

\- Techniques adapted for limited datasets (SMOGN, LOOCV)

\- Batch retraining strategy based on temporal validation

\- Model evaluation using standard regression metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE) and residual plots

\- Explainability via Permutation Importance
